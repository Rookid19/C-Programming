command - gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89 myfile.c -o myfile
This command will compile myfile.c with the specified flags and generate an executable file called myfile.

Here's a brief explanation of the options used in this command:

-Wall: Enables all warning messages.
-Werror: Treats all warnings as errors.
-pedantic: Causes the compiler to be more strict about conforming to the C standard.
-Wextra: Enables additional warning messages beyond those enabled by -Wall.
-std=gnu89: Specifies that the code being compiled should be treated as C code written for the C89 standard, with GNU extensions.
myfile.c: The name of the C source file you want to compile.
-o myfile: Specifies the name of the output file generated by the compiler. In this case, it will be called myfile.

The command "wc -l file" is used to count the number of lines in a file.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Store the C file name in a variable
CFILE="your_c_file.c"

# Run the preprocessor on the C file and save the output to a file
gcc -E "$CFILE" -o c

```
In this script, the gcc command is used with the -E option to run the C file through the preprocessor. The output of the preprocessor is then saved to a file called c using the -o option. You can modify the value of the $CFILE variable to specify the name of your own C file.

```
# Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link
```
#!/bin/bash
gcc -c $CFILE -o "${CFILE%.c}.o"
```
